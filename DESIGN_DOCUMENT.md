# StyleGenius - Design Document

## Executive Summary

StyleGenius is an AI-powered fashion recommendation mobile application that combines machine learning, color theory, and user psychology to create personalized capsule wardrobes. The app delivers a sophisticated yet intuitive experience through a style quiz, intelligent recommendations, and interactive outfit visualization.

## Problem Statement

Traditional fashion apps lack personalization depth and scientific backing. Users struggle with:
- Generic recommendations that don't match personal style
- Overwhelming choices without clear guidance
- Difficulty creating cohesive wardrobes
- No understanding of why items are recommended

## Solution Architecture

### Core Innovation: Serendipity-Controlled Recommendations
```
Recommendation Score = α × Similarity + β × Novelty + γ × Diversity
```
Where users control α and β through the serendipity slider, balancing familiar vs. adventurous recommendations.

### Technical Stack

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Data Layer**: 2000+ fashion items with CLIP embeddings
- **ML Pipeline**: Cosine similarity + greedy optimization
- **API Design**: RESTful with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Performance**: O(n) algorithms with pre-computed embeddings

#### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
- **Architecture**: Component-based with hooks for state management
- **Navigation**: Stack navigator with smooth transitions
- **UI Framework**: Custom components with consistent design system
- **Responsiveness**: Adaptive layouts for various screen sizes

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Capsule Wardrobe Optimization
**Objective**: Maximize outfit combinations within budget constraints

```python
def capsule_optimizer(liked_ids, budget=12):
    while len(capsule) < budget:
        best_item = argmax(similarity × α + coverage × β + diversity × γ)
        capsule.append(best_item)
    return capsule
```

**Innovation**: Multi-objective scoring that balances user preference, wardrobe coverage, and outfit diversity.

### 2. Serendipity Engine
**Challenge**: Balance familiarity with discovery

```python
serendipity_score = (1-s) × similarity + s × novelty
# s=0: safe recommendations, s=1: adventurous exploration
```

**Impact**: Users can dynamically adjust their comfort zone for recommendations.

### 3. Style Personality Classification
**Categories**:
- Adventurous Casual
- Classic Casual  
- Professional Minimalist
- Versatile Explorer
- Balanced Stylist

**Method**: Multi-dimensional analysis of color diversity, category preferences, and usage patterns.

## User Experience Design

### Design Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time responses to user actions
3. **Personalization**: Every interaction tailored to user preferences
4. **Explainability**: Clear reasoning for all recommendations

### User Journey
```
Welcome → Quiz (20 items) → Profile Analysis → Capsule Generation → Outfit Exploration
```

### Key Interactions
- **Swipe-like Quiz**: Familiar interaction pattern for style preferences
- **Interactive Sliders**: Real-time adjustment of recommendations
- **Outfit Visualizer**: Gamified wardrobe exploration
- **Explanation Cards**: Educational content about style choices

## Data Science Approach

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: 2000+ curated fashion items
- **Features**: Category, color, usage, season, brand, description
- **Embeddings**: 512-dimensional CLIP vectors for semantic similarity
- **Quality**: Cleaned and deduplicated for consistency

### Feature Engineering
1. **Color Extraction**: K-means clustering on product images
2. **Category Mapping**: Hierarchical classification (Master → Sub → Article)
3. **Semantic Embeddings**: CLIP model for visual-textual understanding
4. **Trend Scoring**: Temporal and popularity-based weighting

### Model Validation
- **Similarity Accuracy**: Cosine similarity correlation with human judgment
- **Diversity Metrics**: Intra-list diversity measurement
- **Coverage Analysis**: Category and color distribution in recommendations

## Innovation Highlights

### 1. Color Harmony Integration
**Scientific Basis**: Color theory principles (complementary, analogous, triadic)
**Implementation**: Automated color palette suggestions based on user preferences
**Impact**: Helps users discover new colors that work with their existing style

### 2. Outfit Compatibility Scoring
**Algorithm**: Multi-factor compatibility analysis
- Color coordination (30 points)
- Usage alignment (25 points)  
- Seasonal appropriateness (20 points)
- Style completeness (25 points)

**Visualization**: Interactive mannequin with real-time scoring

### 3. Explainable Recommendations
**Challenge**: Black-box ML models lack transparency
**Solution**: Rule-based explanation generation
```python
def generate_explanation(item, user_profile):
    reasons = []
    if color_match: reasons.append("matches your favorite colors")
    if category_preference: reasons.append("fits your style category")
    return f"Selected because it {' and '.join(reasons)}"
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Backend Optimizations
- **Embedding Caching**: Pre-computed similarity matrices
